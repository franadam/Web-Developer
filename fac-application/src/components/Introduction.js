          I am Fran√ßois,<br /> a biomedical worker and hopefully a soon to be web developer.

        <p>
        I possess a robust training in mathematics and programming.
        I have been learning frontend development for a few months on <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/fcc8ab3e79f-4203-4b47-9439-59b4396f3dae'> FreeCodeCamp.org</a> and I have a keen interest in technical area to be able to create new technology.
        In addition to healthcare, ecology and energy have been a preoccupation of mine for a sometime now and that is the reason why as a student I worked in wastewater treatment plants and waste sorting plants for several years.
